    "This is a demo notebook for [EasyTransformer](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/Easy-Transformer), **a library I ([Neel Nanda](neelnanda.io)) wrote for doing [mechanistic interpretability](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/) of GPT-2 Style language models.** The goal of mechanistic interpretability is to take a trained model and reverse engineer the algorithms the model learned during training from its weights. It is a fact about the world today that we have computer programs that can essentially speak English at a human level (GPT-3, PaLM, etc), yet we have no idea how they work nor how to write one ourselves. This offends me greatly, and I would like to solve this! Mechanistic interpretability is a very young and small field, and there are a *lot* of open problems - if you would like to help, please try working on one! **Check out my [list of concrete open problems](TODO: link) to figure out where to start.**\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote this library because after I left the Anthropic interpretability team and started doing independent research, I got extremely frustrated by the state of open source tooling. There's a lot of excellent infrastructure like HuggingFace and DeepSpeed to *use* or *train* models, but very little to dig into their internals and reverse engineer how they work. **This library tries to solve that**, and to make it easy to get into the field even if you don't work at an industry org with real infrastructure! The core features were heavily inspired by [Anthropic's excellent Garcon tool](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html). Credit to Nelson Elhage and Chris Olah for building Garcon and showing me the value of good infrastructure for accelerating exploratory research!\n",
    "\n",
    "The core design principle I've followed is to enable exploratory analysis - one of the most fun parts of mechanistic interpretability compared to normal ML is the extremely short feedback loops! The point of this library is to keep the gap between having an experiment idea and seeing the results as small as possible, to make it easy for **research to feel like play** and to enter a flow state. This notebook demonstrates how the library works and how to use it, but if you want to see how well it works for exploratory research, check out [my notebook analysing Indirect Objection Identification](TODO: link) or [my recording of myself doing research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo4QvDn-vsU)!"
