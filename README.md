# Automated Circuit DisCovery 

![](assets/acdc_finds_subgraph.png)

This is the accompanying code to the paper "Towards Automated Circuit Discovery for Mechanistic Interpretability".

* :zap: To run ACDC, see `acdc/main.py`, or <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ArthurConmy/Automatic-Circuit-Discovery/blob/main/colabs/ACDC_Main_Demo.ipynb">this Colab notebook</a>
* :wrench: To see how edit edges in computational graphs in models, see `notebooks/editing_edges.py` or <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ArthurConmy/Automatic-Circuit-Discovery/blob/main/notebooks/colabs/ACDC_Editing_Edges_Demo.ipynb">this Colab notebook</a>

## Installation:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens.git cmapy torchtyping
git clone git+https://github.com/ArthurConmy/Automatic-Circuit-Discovery.git
cd Automatic-Circuit-Discovery
pip install -e .
```

### Details

This codebase currently works on top of the TransformerLens main branch (as of 6th June 2023), so probably `transformer_lens==1.2.3` or later (for now, you need to install TransformerLens from source, such as by using the above fast installation command).


You may also need do this

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ffmpeg libsm6 libxext6 graphviz
```

in order to install graphics dependencies on linux.

## Tests

From the root directory, run 

```bash
pytest -vvv
```

## Contributing 

We welcome issues where the code is unclear!

If you make a PR, make sure you run 
```bash
chmod +x experiments/make_notebooks.sh
./experiments/make_notebooks.sh
```
And check that no errors arise. It is essential that the notebooks converted here consist only of `#%% [markdown]` markdown-only cells, and `#%%` cells with code.

## TODO

[ x ] Make `TransformerLens` install be Neel's code not my PR

[ x ] Add `hook_mlp_in` to `TransformerLens` and delete `hook_resid_mid` (and test to ensure no bad things?)

[ x ] Delete `arthur-try-merge-tl` references from the repo

[ ] Fix huge edge sizes in Induction Main example

[ ] Find a better way to deal with the versioning on the Colabs installs...

[ ] Neuron-level experiments

[ ] Position-level experiments

[ ] `tracr` and other dependencies better managed

[ ] Make SP tests work (lots outdated so skipped) - and check SubnetworkProbing installs properly (no __init__.pys !!!)

[ ] Make the 9 tests also failing on TransformerLens-main pass
