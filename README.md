# Automated Circuit DisCovery 

This is the accompanying code to the paper "Towards Automated Circuit Discovery for Mechanistic Interpretability".

* :zap: To run ACDC, see `acdc/main.py`, or <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ArthurConmy/Automatic-Circuit-Discovery/blob/main/notebooks/colabs/ACDC_Main_Demo.ipynb">this Colab notebook</a>
* :wrench: To see how edit edges in computational graphs in models, see `notebooks/editing_edges.py` or <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ArthurConmy/Automatic-Circuit-Discovery/blob/main/notebooks/colabs/ACDC_Editing_Edges_Demo.ipynb">this Colab notebook</a>

## Fast installation:

```bash
pip install git@https://github.com/ArthurConmy/Automatic-Circuit-Discovery.git@arthur-patch-resid-mid git@https://github.com/ArthurConmy/Automatic-Circuit-Discovery.git cmapy torchtyping
```

### Details

This codebase currently works on top of the TransformerLens main branch (as of 4th June 2023), so probably `transformer_lens==1.2.3` or later (for now, install TransformerLens from source).

You may also need do this

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ffmpeg libsm6 libxext6 graphviz
```

in order to install graphics dependencies on linux.

## Tests

From the root directory, run 

```bash
pytest -vvv
```

## TODO

[ ] Make `TransformerLens` install be Neel's code not my PR

[ ] Add `hook_mlp_in` to `TransformerLens` and delete `hook_resid_mid` (and test to ensure no bad things?)

[ ] Delete `arthur-try-merge-tl` references from the repo

[ ] Neuron-level experiments

[ ] Position-level experiments

[ ] `tracr` and other dependencies better managed

[ ] Make SP tests work (lots outdated so skipped) - and check they install (no __init__.pys !!!)

[ ] Make the 9 tests also failing on TransformerLens-main pass
